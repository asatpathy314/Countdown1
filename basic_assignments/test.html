    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, I'm Abhishek Satpathy, but I go by Abhi. I'm a student at the UVA Engineering School, where I'm majoring in Computer Science. I love to learn more about AI and Cybersecurity, and if I'm not doing that you'll probably find me in the gym.</p>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <p>If you want a better overview take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/asatpathy314">GitHub</a>, but some of my proudest projects are TravelSafe, a one-stop shop for your travel safety information, and my Toolset for NER Model Analysis that I developed while working at Link Lab.</p>
